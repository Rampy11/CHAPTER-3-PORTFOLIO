# CHAPTER-3-PORTFOLIO
Learning Dart Basics was an essential step in building my foundation for Flutter development. I began by exploring the syntax and structure of Dart, familiarizing myself with its object-oriented nature and strong typing system. I practiced declaring variables using var, final, and const, understanding the differences in mutability and runtime evaluation. Diving into control flow, I wrote simple programs using conditional statements (if, else, switch) and loops (for, while, do-while) to strengthen my logic-building skills.

I then focused on Dartâ€™s unique features, such as null safety, which helps prevent runtime errors by requiring explicit handling of nullable variables. Functions became a key area of study, where I learned about optional parameters, arrow syntax, and closures to write concise and expressive code. Additionally, I worked on defining classes, constructors, and methods, while exploring key object-oriented principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in Dart.

To solidify my understanding, I implemented small projects and solved algorithm challenges, experimenting with Dart collections (List, Set, and Map) to manage and manipulate data. Learning Dart also included utilizing asynchronous programming with Future and Stream, enabling me to write non-blocking, efficient code. This journey provided me with a strong grasp of Dart's syntax, features, and best practices, laying a robust foundation for developing efficient, maintainable Flutter applications and establishing this as a valuable skill in my portfolio.
